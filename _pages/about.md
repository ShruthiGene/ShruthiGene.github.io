I am a Postdoctoral Research Fellow at the [Knight Cancer Institute, OHSU](https://www.ohsu.edu/knight-cancer-institute), working in the laboratory of [Dr. Julia Maxson](https://www.ohsu.edu/knight-cancer-institute/maxson-lab). My research focuses on understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying leukemia development and drug resistance, with a particular interest in chronic neutrophilic leukemia and atypical chronic myeloid leukemia.

## research focus

My work combines experimental biology and computational approaches to study how mutations in signaling and transcription factor proteins drive leukemia development. I am particularly interested in how transcriptional and epigenetic changes in cell-type specific disease contexts contribute to drug resistance mechanisms, with the ultimate goal of improving patient survival.

During my PhD at the University of New South Wales in the [John Pimanda Lab](https://research.unsw.edu.au/people/professor-john-pimanda), I elucidated dynamic molecular landscapes across human hematopoietic stem cell differentiation. I developed expertise in next-generation sequencing (NGS) data analysis, including RNA-seq, ChIP-seq, and ATAC-seq, to decipher hematopoietic landscapes in both normal homeostasis and leukemic conditions. This work transitioned me from a wet lab biologist to a hybrid researcher with strong bioinformatics capabilities.

## education & background

I received my PhD in Medicine from the University of New South Wales, Sydney, Australia (2018–2022), where I focused on transcription factors regulating hematopoietic differentiation. Prior to that, I completed my Bachelor of Technology in Bioengineering from SASTRA University, India (2010–2014), graduating with First Class Distinction.

My research experience spans multiple institutions, including postdoctoral work at OHSU, PhD research at UNSW, and previous research positions at [Brigham and Women’s Hospital](https://www.brighamandwomens.org/) (Boston), Cancer Institute WIA (Chennai), and the [Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT)](https://www.mit.edu/) (Cambridge).

## career goal

My career goal is to become an accomplished independent researcher in leukemia biology, focusing on molecular mechanisms of drug resistance in hematologic malignancies. I am committed to mentoring the next generation of STEM scientists and developing a unique research niche in the hematology research community.
