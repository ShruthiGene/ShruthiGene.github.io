Our work on **BloodChIP Xtra: an expanded database of comparative genome-wide transcription factor binding and gene-expression profiles in healthy human stem/progenitor subsets and leukemic cells** has been published in Nucleic Acids Research.

This database provides comprehensive transcription factor binding and gene expression data for hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells, enabling researchers to explore regulatory networks in both normal and leukemic contexts.

The database is freely available and represents a significant resource for the hematology research community.
